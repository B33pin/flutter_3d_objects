**[Flutter 3D Objects]**

**Features:**
- Displays a 3D model of a pallet with cartons.
- Allows rotating the model left or right.
- Shows labels for the cartons when viewed from specific angles.

**How to use this**
  - Add dependency in pubspec.yaml
  ```yaml
  dependencies:
   flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_3d_objects:
  ```
  - Add 3D Models in assets, file type should be .obj
  ```yaml
  flutter:
  assets:
  - assets/pallet.obj
  - assets/carton.obj
  ```
  - Use the PalletViewer widget in your application, In PalletViewer we have a Cube, and we add different objects in the scene of the Cube, Cube can have many Childrens.
  - **Scene Creation** The _onSceneCreated method initializes the scene, sets up the camera position, and adds the pallet and cartons to the scene. Here's a breakdown of this method:
      - **Camera Position:** Sets the initial position of the camera.
      - **Pallet Object:** Creates the pallet object and adds child objects (cartons) to it.
      - **Labels:** Adds labels for the cartons to a list for later display.
  - **Rotation** The rotateLeft and rotateRight methods animate the rotation of the pallet. The _animateRotation method uses an AnimationController and a Tween to smoothly rotate the pallet:
      - **AnimationController:** Manages the timing of the animation.
      - **Tween:** Defines the start and end values for the animation.
      - **Listener:** Updates the pallet's rotation and refreshes the scene on each animation frame.
  - **Labels** The _shouldShowLabels method determines if the labels should be shown based on the pallet's rotation. The _buildLabels method creates the label widgets and positions them on the screen. The _calculateScreenPosition method calculates the screen position for each label based on its 3D position.
  - **Object** In the context of flutter_cube, an Object represents a 3D model or a group of 3D models. An Object can have properties such as position, scale, rotation, and it can be composed of other child objects. Hereâ€™s an example of how an Object is created and added to the scene:
  ``` dart
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      body: Center(
        child: Cube(
          onSceneCreated: (Scene scene) {
            scene.world.add(
            Object(
            fileName: 'assets/carton.obj',
            position: Vector3(1, 1, 1),
            scale: Vector3(1, 1, 1),
            ),
            );
          },
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
  ```
  - **Vector3** Vector3 is a class representing a 3-dimensional vector. It is used to define the position, scale, and rotation of objects in the 3D space. Each Vector3 instance has three components: x, y, and z.
      - **Position:** Defines where the object is located in the 3D space.
      - **Scale:** Defines the size of the object in the 3D space.
